🧠 First: The Rule You Must Follow

If your “{area}/{service}” pages have 80% similar content → Google demotes them as doorway pages.

If they are 40–60% unique → Google rewards them.

So your goal per area page = 400–800 words where at least 250–400 words are unique to that area.

✅ EXACT AMOUNT OF UNIQUE CONTENT PER AREA

To be safe, rank fast, and avoid duplicate-content penalties:

✔ Minimum unique content for each area:

250 words unique to that area

✔ Optimal (best rankings):

350–500 words unique

✔ SEO-dominating:

700+ words unique (only for high-value areas)
(e.g., Didsbury, Sale, Chorlton, Stockport)

But here’s the trick:
You don’t write 700 words of “essay content” — you write useful local-specific SEO signals.

🟢 WHAT COUNTS AS “UNIQUE CONTENT”?

Google doesn’t want “same page + new area name”.

What Google LOVES is area-specific signals:

1️⃣ Local property types

Didsbury → lots of Victorian homes with wool carpets

Salford → apartments with synthetic carpets

Stockport → semi-detached houses with pets

Manchester City Centre → flats with communal carpets

This alone is highly unique.

2️⃣ Local cleaning problems

student accommodation = heavy stains

pet-heavy households

high-traffic commercial areas

near parks → mud / dust issues

near main roads → soot & pollution

Each area has different realities → unique content.

3️⃣ Local landmarks

Drop 2–3 local references:

Example:
“In Chorlton, many clients live around Beech Road, where wool carpets are common and require gentler pH-balanced cleaning.”

These aren’t filler — they’re entity signals.
Google understands landmarks as local entities, boosting local ranking massively.

4️⃣ Local reviews or case studies

Even simple lines count:

“A customer from Burton Road, West Didsbury had a heavily stained wool carpet we restored using hot-water extraction…”

Case studies are SEO gold.

5️⃣ Local pricing differences

Some areas have mostly flats → cheaper jobs

Some areas have bigger houses → higher ticket size

This becomes unique content.

6️⃣ Localised FAQ

Add 2–3 questions unique to that area:

“Do you cover late-night jobs in Didsbury?”

“Can you access apartment buildings in Manchester City Centre?”

“Do you remove odour from pet-heavy homes in Chorlton?”
