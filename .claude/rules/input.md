title: MANDATORY BMad Feature Development Protocol
author: Senior Engineer with 17+ Years Experience + BMad Multi-Agent System
purpose: ENFORCED self-orchestrating development workflow with MANDATORY quality gates
version: 3.0.0
enforcement: STRICT - ALL steps must be completed in sequence
---

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**YOU MUST FOLLOW EVERY STEP IN THIS DOCUMENT.**

When the user attaches this file (@.claude/rules/input.md), it means:
1. **MANDATORY BMad workflow** - You CANNOT skip any phase
2. **MANDATORY quality checks** - Including SEO, accessibility, performance
3. **MANDATORY documentation** - All artifacts must be created
4. **MANDATORY agent transitions** - Follow the exact agent sequence

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW = INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**

---

# 🎯 MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL

## 📋 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE STARTING)

Before writing ANY code, you MUST:

```yaml
☐ 1. Read user request completely
☐ 2. Identify task complexity (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
☐ 3. Determine project type (GREENFIELD/BROWNFIELD)
☐ 4. Select appropriate BMad workflow
☐ 5. Present orchestration plan to user
☐ 6. Get user approval before proceeding
☐ 7. Create TODO list with ALL phases
```

**STOP: Do not proceed until checklist complete**

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW MATRIX

### **Rule 1: Task Complexity Classification**

```
LOW COMPLEXITY → Direct Implementation (No BMad)
├─ Single file changes
├─ Bug fixes
├─ Documentation updates
└─ Configuration tweaks

MEDIUM COMPLEXITY → Lightweight BMad (UX → Dev → SEO)
├─ 2-5 file changes
├─ New components
├─ API endpoints
└─ Database schema updates

HIGH COMPLEXITY → FULL BMad Workflow (MANDATORY)
├─ New features (6+ files)
├─ Cluster pages
├─ Multi-component systems
├─ Architecture changes
└─ New product capabilities
```

### **Rule 2: Workflow Selection (ENFORCED)**

```
IF task mentions ANY of these keywords:
  - "cluster page"
  - "pillar page"
  - "landing page"
  - "service page"
  - "new feature"
  - "epic"
  - "user flow"

THEN:
  ✅ MANDATORY: FULL BMad Workflow
  ✅ MANDATORY: SEO Checklist
  ✅ MANDATORY: Accessibility Audit
  ✅ MANDATORY: Performance Optimization
```

## 🎭 MANDATORY BMAD AGENT SEQUENCE

### **For HIGH COMPLEXITY Tasks (STRICTLY ENFORCED)**

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THESE PHASES IN ORDER. NO SKIPPING.**

## 🚨 ANTI-SKIP ENFORCEMENT RULES

### **Rule 1: Phase Completion Verification**

After EVERY phase, you MUST:

```markdown
## ✅ Phase [N] Complete

**Phase:** [Phase Name]
**Duration:** [Actual Time]
**Output:** [Artifact Created]

**Verification Checklist:**
☑ TODO marked complete
☑ Output artifact exists
☑ Quality gate passed
☑ Ready for next phase

---

**Moving to Phase [N+1]...**
```

### **Rule 2: SEO Phase is NON-NEGOTIABLE**

```
IF task involves ANY page creation:
  THEN SEO Phase 5 is MANDATORY

IF you complete Phase 4 without Phase 5:
  YOU HAVE FAILED THE TASK

PHASE 5 CANNOT BE SKIPPED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
```

### **Rule 3: Quality Gates Are Blocking**

```
IF quality gate FAILS:
  THEN you MUST return to previous phase
  AND fix all issues
  AND re-verify
  BEFORE proceeding

NO EXCEPTIONS
```

## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

1. **ULTRATHINK + BMad + TECHNICAL RULES = EXCELLENCE**
   - BMad provides structure
   - Ultrathink provides craftsmanship
   - Technical rules provide standards

2. **SEO IS NOT OPTIONAL**
   - If creating/editing a page → SEO Phase MANDATORY
   - 6+ schemas minimum
   - Speakable classes required
   - TL;DR section required

3. **QUALITY GATES ARE BLOCKING**
   - If FAIL → Return to previous phase
   - If CONCERNS → Proceed with tracking
   - If PASS → Proceed to next phase

4. **SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION**
   - Complete phase N before starting N+1
   - Mark TODO items as you go
   - Verify checkpoints

5. **USER VISIBILITY**
   - Always show orchestration plan first
   - Update TODO list in real-time
   - Announce phase transitions
