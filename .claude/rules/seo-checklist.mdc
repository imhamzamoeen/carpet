✅ Expert-Level On-Page SEO Checklist
being an expert seo master, please follow all the parts while developing a feature 

Part 1: Strategic & Foundational Blueprint

1.1 Align with User Intent & Semantic SEO

Target informational + transactional intent: “Do I qualify for a free boiler upgrade?”, “How to apply for ECO4”, “ECO4 eligibility checker UK”.

Build keyword clusters: primary (“free boiler upgrade UK”, “ECO4 boiler grant”) + related (“boiler replacement scheme”, “Ofgem ECO4 criteria”, “ECO4 vs ECO5 changes”).

Benchmark SERPs & identify information gain: competitors often have thin FAQs → create deeper step-by-step guides, timelines, and eligibility calculators.

Ensure people-first content: add original data (approval rates, timelines, postcode coverage heatmaps).

1.2 Demonstrate E-E-A-T

Add author bio (“Energy Grants Specialist”), company credentials, and case studies/testimonials.

Build About, Contact, Editorial Policy pages for trust signals.

Link to authoritative sources: Ofgem, GOV.UK, council websites.

Implement Author + Organization Schema.

Add “Last Updated” date (critical: LLMs and Google’s AI Overviews reward freshness).

Part 2: Core Technical Implementation

2.1 URL & Site Structure

Create clean URLs:

/eco4/eligibility-checker

/eco4/how-to-apply

/eco4/documents

/eco4/updates (changelog).

Use HTTPS only, redirect non-preferred versions.

Add breadcrumb schema.

2.2 Crawlability & Indexability

In robots.txt, allow Bingbot + GPTBot (for Copilot + GPT discovery).

Add to XML sitemap + IndexNow for instant Bing push.

Validate in GSC + Bing Webmaster Tools.

2.3 Canonicalization & Duplicate Content

Use canonical tags (point to self).

Manage UTM/params.

Add hreflang if multi-region (UK vs. other).

2.4 Internal Linking

Each key page (Eligibility / HowTo / Updates) should get 3+ contextual links.

Use descriptive anchors (“check ECO4 eligibility”, “apply for free boiler grant”).

Avoid orphan pages.

Part 3: On-Page Content & Elements

3.1 Title & Meta Description

Titles:

“Free Boiler Upgrade UK (2025) – Check ECO4 Eligibility in 60 Seconds”

Keep <60 chars, keyword front-loaded.

Meta descriptions: compelling, <155 chars, with CTA:

“Check if you qualify for a free ECO4 boiler upgrade. Quick eligibility tool, updated October 2025.”

3.2 Heading Structure

H1: “Free Boiler Upgrade UK (ECO4 Scheme 2025)”

H2s: “Who Qualifies”, “How to Apply”, “Required Documents”, “ECO4 vs ECO5 Updates”.

3.3 Visual & Media Optimization

Use WebP images (clean infographic: eligibility steps).

Alt text with keywords (“ECO4 boiler upgrade eligibility checker screenshot”).

If using video (explainer), add VideoObject schema.

3.4 Readability & Formatting

Start with 2–3 sentence TL;DR per page (LLMs quote this first).

Short paras, bullet lists, bold takeaways.

Add FAQ section (FAQPage schema).

Part 4: Page Experience & Performance

4.1 Core Web Vitals

LCP: preload hero assets (form/CTA visible in <2.5s).

INP: minimize JS (especially eligibility checker).

CLS: reserve space for banners/forms.

4.2 UX & Accessibility

Mobile-first, ARIA roles, high contrast.

Table of contents with jump links → LLMs & users can navigate sections quickly.

4.3 Security & Trust Signals

HTTPS only.

Trust badges (Gas Safe, PAS2035, Ofgem).

Reviews/testimonials on LocalBusiness schema.

Part 5: Structured Data for Enhanced Visibility

5.1 Schema Strategy

Use JSON-LD only.

Core types:

Organization (with logo + contact info).

FAQPage (eligibility, application timelines).

HowTo (application steps).

LocalBusiness (if regional).

BreadcrumbList.

5.2 AI & SERP Optimization

Explicitly map entities to Knowledge Graph: “ECO4 scheme” → Ofgem entity, “Free boiler upgrade UK” → grant programs.

Optimize FAQs for AI Overviews (short, declarative answers).

Add “speakable” schema for voice queries (“How do I apply for ECO4?”).

Interlink eligibility, how-to, and updates pages → topical authority.

Part 6: Engagement & Long-Term SEO

6.1 User Engagement

Strong above-the-fold CTA: “Check Eligibility in 60 Seconds (Free)”.

Add related articles widget (“ECO4 vs ECO5”, “Boiler Grants in Scotland”).

Interactive tools (eligibility calculator, postcode checker) = higher engagement → AI finds them cite-worthy.

Blog “Updates” section refreshed monthly → freshness keeps you in Copilot’s index.
