✅ Expert-Level On-Page SEO Checklist
being an expert seo master, please follow all the parts while developing a feature

Part 1: Strategic & Foundational Blueprint

1.1 Align with User Intent & Semantic SEO

Target informational + transactional intent: "How much does carpet cleaning cost?", "Best carpet cleaners near me", "Professional carpet cleaning Manchester".

Build keyword clusters: primary ("carpet cleaning Manchester", "professional carpet cleaners near me") + related ("carpet steam cleaning", "upholstery cleaning Manchester", "rug cleaning near me").

Benchmark SERPs & identify information gain: competitors often have thin FAQs → create deeper step-by-step guides, before/after galleries, and pricing calculators.

Ensure people-first content: add original data (customer reviews, average cleaning times, service area coverage maps).

1.2 Demonstrate E-E-A-T

Add author bio ("Carpet Cleaning Specialist"), company credentials (IICRC certified, years in business), and case studies/testimonials.

Build About, Contact, Privacy Policy pages for trust signals.

Link to authoritative sources: IICRC, NCCA, industry associations.

Implement Author + Organization Schema.

Add "Last Updated" date (critical: LLMs and Google's AI Overviews reward freshness).

Part 2: Core Technical Implementation

2.1 URL & Site Structure

Create clean URLs:

/carpet-cleaning

/upholstery-cleaning

/rug-cleaning

/mattress-cleaning

/areas/manchester

/areas/trafford

Use HTTPS only, redirect non-preferred versions.

Add breadcrumb schema.

2.2 Crawlability & Indexability

In robots.txt, allow Bingbot + GPTBot (for Copilot + GPT discovery).

Add to XML sitemap + IndexNow for instant Bing push.

Validate in GSC + Bing Webmaster Tools.

2.3 Canonicalization & Duplicate Content

Use canonical tags (point to self).

Manage UTM/params.

Add hreflang if multi-region (UK vs. other).

2.4 Internal Linking

Each key page (Services / Areas / Reviews) should get 3+ contextual links.

Use descriptive anchors ("carpet cleaning in Manchester", "professional upholstery cleaning", "rug cleaning near me").

Avoid orphan pages.

Part 3: On-Page Content & Elements

3.1 Title & Meta Description

Titles:

"Carpet Cleaning Manchester | Professional Service | Fresh Fiber"

Keep <60 chars, keyword front-loaded.

Meta descriptions: compelling, <155 chars, with CTA:

"Expert carpet cleaning in Manchester. Same-day service, eco-friendly methods, 100% satisfaction guarantee. Get your free quote in 60 seconds."

3.2 Heading Structure

H1: "Professional Carpet Cleaning in Manchester"

H2s: "Our Cleaning Services", "Why Choose Fresh Fiber", "Areas We Cover", "What Our Customers Say".

3.3 Visual & Media Optimization

Use WebP images (before/after photos, cleaning process).

Alt text with keywords ("Professional carpet cleaning service in Manchester living room").

If using video (cleaning process), add VideoObject schema.

3.4 Readability & Formatting

Start with 2–3 sentence TL;DR per page (LLMs quote this first).

Short paras, bullet lists, bold takeaways.

Add FAQ section (FAQPage schema).

Part 4: Page Experience & Performance

4.1 Core Web Vitals

LCP: preload hero assets (form/CTA visible in <2.5s).

INP: minimize JS (especially eligibility checker).

CLS: reserve space for banners/forms.

4.2 UX & Accessibility

Mobile-first, ARIA roles, high contrast.

Table of contents with jump links → LLMs & users can navigate sections quickly.

4.3 Security & Trust Signals

HTTPS only.

Trust badges (IICRC Certified, NCCA Member, Insurance).

Reviews/testimonials on LocalBusiness schema.

Part 5: Structured Data for Enhanced Visibility

5.1 Schema Strategy

Use JSON-LD only.

Core types:

Organization (with logo + contact info).

FAQPage (eligibility, application timelines).

HowTo (application steps).

LocalBusiness (if regional).

BreadcrumbList.

5.2 AI & SERP Optimization

Explicitly map entities to Knowledge Graph: "Fresh Fiber Carpet Cleaning" → local business entity, "carpet cleaning Manchester" → service + location.

Optimize FAQs for AI Overviews (short, declarative answers).

Add "speakable" schema for voice queries ("How much does carpet cleaning cost?", "Best carpet cleaners near me").

**Speakable Schema Implementation:**

Create a SpeakableSpecification schema to identify content sections suitable for text-to-speech (TTS) output on Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, and other voice assistants:

```typescript
// src/components/structured-data/SpeakableSchema.tsx
interface SpeakableSchemaProps {
  serviceName: string
  shortDescription: string
  priceFrom: string
}

export function SpeakableSchema({ serviceName, shortDescription, priceFrom }: SpeakableSchemaProps) {
  const schema = {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'WebPage',
    name: `${serviceName} Manchester`,
    description: `${shortDescription}. Professional service in Manchester with same-day availability. Prices from ${priceFrom}.`,
    speakable: {
      '@type': 'SpeakableSpecification',
      cssSelector: [
        '.speakable-headline',     // H1 service name
        '.speakable-tldr',         // TL;DR summary
        '.speakable-pricing',      // Pricing information
        '.speakable-cta',          // Call to action
      ],
      // Alternative: use XPath selectors
      xpath: [
        '/html/head/title',
        "//h1[@class='speakable-headline']",
        "//div[@class='speakable-tldr']",
      ],
    },
  };

  return (
    <script
      type="application/ld+json"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }}
    />
  );
}
```

**Add Speakable CSS Classes to Content:**

```typescript
// H1 Headline
<h1 className="speakable-headline">
  {service.name}
</h1>

// TL;DR Summary (for LLMs and voice assistants)
<div className="speakable-tldr">
  <p>{service.shortDescription}. Professional service in Manchester with same-day availability, 100% satisfaction guarantee. Prices from {service.pricing.from}.</p>
</div>

// Pricing Section
<div className="speakable-pricing">
  <h3>Pricing</h3>
  <span>{service.pricing.from}</span>
</div>

// Call to Action
<div className="speakable-cta">
  <button>Get Free Quote</button>
  <a href="tel:+441234567890">Call Now</a>
</div>
```

**Benefits:**
- Critical for "near me" queries and voice-activated searches
- Improves visibility in Google Assistant voice responses
- Optimizes for featured snippets read aloud by smart speakers
- Helps AI systems identify the most important content sections

Interlink service pages, area pages, and FAQ pages → topical authority.

Part 6: Engagement & Long-Term SEO

6.1 User Engagement

Strong above-the-fold CTA: "Get Your Free Quote in 60 Seconds".

Add related articles widget ("Carpet Cleaning Cost Guide", "How to Remove Wine Stains", "DIY vs Professional Cleaning").

Interactive tools (quote calculator, postcode checker, service area map) = higher engagement → AI finds them cite-worthy.

Blog "Updates" section refreshed monthly → freshness keeps you in Copilot's index.
